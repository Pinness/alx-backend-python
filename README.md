# 0x01. Python - Async Function

## Project Overview

This project introduces asynchronous programming in Python, with a focus on using `async`, `await`, coroutines, tasks, and measuring runtime for async functions. The goal is to understand and practice concurrency using Pythonâ€™s `asyncio` library.

## Learning Objectives

- How to write asynchronous functions using `async` and `await`.
- How to run multiple coroutines at the same time.
- How to use Python's `asyncio.Task`.
- How to measure execution time for async functions.
- Understanding concurrency and task management in Python.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Code must adhere to PEP 8 guidelines.
- The project is executed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

## Project Files

### 0. The Basics of `async`

- **File**: `0-basic_async_syntax.py`
- **Description**: Write an asynchronous coroutine `wait_random` that takes an integer argument `max_delay` and waits for a random delay between 0 and `max_delay`, then returns the delay.
